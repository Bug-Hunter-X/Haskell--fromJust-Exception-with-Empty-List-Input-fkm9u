This Haskell code attempts to use a function that operates on lists of Maybe values, but it fails to handle the case where the list is empty.  This leads to a runtime error. 
```haskell
import Data.Maybe

myFunction :: [Maybe Int] -> Maybe Int
myFunction xs = listToMaybe $ map ("maybeValue" -> fromJust maybeValue) xs

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result1 = myFunction [Just 1, Just 2, Just 3]
  print result1  -- Output: Just 1

  let result2 = myFunction []
  print result2  -- Output: *** Exception: Prelude.fromJust: Nothing
```
