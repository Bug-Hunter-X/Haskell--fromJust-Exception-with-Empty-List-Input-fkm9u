The solution involves using pattern matching to handle the empty list case and using a safer function like `catMaybes` to avoid the `fromJust` function entirely.
```haskell
import Data.Maybe

myFunction :: [Maybe Int] -> Maybe Int
myFunction [] = Nothing  -- Handle the empty list case
myFunction xs = listToMaybe $ map fromJust $ catMaybes xs

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result1 = myFunction [Just 1, Just 2, Just 3]
  print result1  -- Output: Just 1

  let result2 = myFunction []
  print result2  -- Output: Nothing

  let result3 = myFunction [Just 1, Nothing, Just 3]
  print result3 -- Output: Just 1
```
